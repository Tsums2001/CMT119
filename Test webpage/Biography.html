      <p>Joan Clarke is one of the important figures in breaking the German Enigma ciphers,
         she was a young mathematician who broke 3 signals in the German Enigma and was only
         paid £2 a week (Erskine, R., 1997). She was one of the only women to work within the
         nerve centre and was head of Hut 8, being the longest serving member.</p>
      <p>Due to Clarke being a woman of the time she was denied her full double first degree
         in mathematics from Cambridge, however through her incredible work in the aid to
         decipher the German Enigma she was able to pave the acceptance for women within the
         realm of not only mathematics, but also computer science with her working on some of
         the hardest ciphers to decode.</p>
      <p>Clarke and her associates used the core principles of Computational Thinking to aid
         them in deciphering and cracking the German Enigma codes to turn the tide in
         World War 2, allowing for new methods to enable them in coding and decoding programs
         to aid not only the war but earlier computers to help scientists with problem such as
         finding approximations for thermonuclear and fission devices
         (Denning, P.J. and Tedre, M., 2021).</p>
      <p>Clarke came from an era where women were not appreciated for intelligence and this
         maybe why we hear quite little of anything else she did within the realms of
         computer science and mathematics. She’s an important figure in computer science
         because it allowed a field once completely dominated by men, to usher in an acceptance
         for women within STEM fields to further push for progress in all academic fields
         essentially double the potential of people that could create groundbreaking research
         in their respected fields.</p>
      <p>Allowing for other renown female computer scientists, such as Cecili R. Aragon
         (an American computer scientist who co-developed one of known binary search trees
         called treap data structure), and Elizabeth Feinler (an American computer scientist
         that managed ARPANET and DDN, two of the biggest networks that eventually become the
         foundation for the world wide web).</p>
