      <p>Throughout the Computational Thinking module, I have learnt how to interpret inputs of
         information through a computational system and receive the output in not only a human
         sense but also how the computer program interprets and realise this information through
         high abstraction. This will be expressed in my future career because I can ascertain how
         computers will interact with pieces of coding without being behind the computer allowing
         me to skills in discussing coding, input/output, and potential errors in programming on
         the go.</p>
      <p>Computional Thinking has given me models to look at and discuss with my peers, to further
         the develop my critical thinking skills. These models have pros and cons, and through
         realising this I understand the limits that are set when discussing programming in a
         metaphysical sense. This is important for my career because it allows me to understand
         that I have limits to abstracting code or setting, adding, or changing, variables within
         discussions, enabling me to understand that not all real-life examples following the same
         method or model. Helping me to be open to new computational models that could be developed
         in the future.</p>
      <p>This module has allowed me to develop my limited knowledge on not only the act of
         understanding how programming works, but also the uses and applications of Html, CSS,
         and JavaScript. I can know fully engage with all three of the software with confidence
         in my ability to understand trouble shooting issues that my occur and be able to research
         more efficient threads of programming through discussion with my peers and online forums
         that have open-sourced programming tools that I fully understand where and how they built
         their program to interact with another piece of coding or programming software.
         Benefitting my career endeavours by giving me ample skills in displaying my knowledge of
         programming software and to understand bits of code and how they interact in a way that
         might be alien to me.</p>
      <p>Finally, this moduleâ€™s knowledge and information will be used continuously throughout
         my masters, as the previously mentioned skills are consequential in enabling me to
         complete my course in Cardiff University. I will need to understand different
         programming languages, learn new programming language and work in teams to show
         prospective employers that I can function within a unit, completing and innovating
         programming languages and programming problems in the future. These skills learnt
         throughout the course inhibits me to discussing programming with others, think in
         computationally with others, and understand the core principles of what programmers
         are trying to achieve in solving their computational problems.</p>
